Improvements made for 3rd submission: Thanks for the reviewers' comments, I fixed the following:

	1. Added the "info" option for filtering the searching function.
	2. Fixed the bug so that the markers on the map are clickable.
	3. Added back the list view of the places shown on the map.
	4. Added the "offline" handling function.
	5. Tested the code in JHint and fixed the errors.
	6. All application components seem to be responsive. 


Improvements made for 2nd submission:

	1. fixed the index.html according to reviewer's comments, such as </div>, removing "type" attribute.
	2. deleted the original venue listing to make the web layout simpler and responsive.
	3. fine-tuned the style.css to follow the udacity css style rules.

However, there are still 2 things that I haven't figured out:
	1. why my picks are not clickable, in other words, why the info window is not showing for each pick?
	2. why isn't the pick centered when clicked?
--- so any help will be appreciated!



Instructions on how to use my Neighborhood Map Page. Note: I put "Stanford, CA" as the default search address as it is my neighborhood.

	1. Download the GitHub ZIP to your computer and extract the zip file; then you can open index.html in your chrome browser.

	2. Or alternatively, fork the repository, load the index.html into you chrome browser.



Other notes: 

1). I chose to use Foursquare.com to show their top picks on the map, since Foursquare.com is my favorite website to refer to when visiting a new city.

2). I listed the pictures of those top picks from foursquare.com on the left to the map shown.

3). I also used the api.nytimes for the city/state that is searched, something that I learned from the udacity course.

4). I got a lot of help from my friends who work as a web developer. 

5). Below are some websites that I searched when working on this project.
